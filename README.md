# hello-world
Ive had a passion for tech since I was a kid Im 43 and got really sick and while I was down for 6 months I started exploring and this is a part of that journey. I hope to actually change the trajectory of my life and go this way I'm a low code no code I am actually becoming a low coder the more I learn automation. I want to leverage the opportunity because never in ones life do you have two world changing possibilites happen and this is #2 for me. The internet was the 1st world changer and now AI thats its become main stream and we all have access to it and not just big corperations and hedge funds. I love this and wish I would have persued it when I was a young man but I didnt. I truly hope that doing this part time will become full time and I can actually build a business around the Ai automation of lead generating for distressed sellers looking to off load their property for a cash offer. Some tims I havee to make myself leave the computer I lovve this stuff so much. I also hope to meet and make friends on this journey. Sincerely Jeff Nick Name and prefered name **Gus**
